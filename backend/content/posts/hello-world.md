Welcome to my new site! I'm excited to finally have a place to share my thoughts on software development, technology, and whatever else catches my interest.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

- **Software development** - Tips, tricks, and lessons learned from building things
- **Home lab adventures** - Documenting my home network and infrastructure projects
- **Tech explorations** - Deep dives into tools and technologies I find interesting

## The Tech Behind This Site

This site is built with a simple but effective stack:

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: React
- **Content**: Markdown files with frontmatter
- **Hosting**: Render

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/lopperman/dotdev).

Stay tuned for more posts!
